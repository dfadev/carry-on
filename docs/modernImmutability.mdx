title: Modern Immutability
---
There are various implentations of immutability in Javascript which require the developer to shift gears when working with immutable data as opposed to mutable data.

`immer` implements a strategy which allows a developer to work with immutable data in a similar way as they would with mutable data.  `carry-on` uses `immer` to provide a clean concise way of changing state values without resorting to a shift in thinking.

```js live noInline
const storeId =  "immutable";

deleteStore(storeId);
connect(storeId);

const store = getStore(storeId);

const initialState = store.get();

store.set(state => {
  state.value1 = "abc";
});

const mutatedState = store.get();

render(
  <>
    <h6>Initial State:</h6>
    <Inspector data={initialState} />
    <h6>Mutated State:</h6>
    <Inspector data={mutatedState} />
  </>
)

```
